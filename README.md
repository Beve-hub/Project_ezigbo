# Ezigbo

## Description

Ezigbo is a Decentralized Application (DApp) with a primary focus on storing and verifying the authenticity of drugs using blockchain technology. Ezigbo aims to address issues related to counterfeit drugs by leveraging the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain.

By utilizing blockchain technology, Ezigbo provides a platform where drug-related information, such as manufacturing details, batch numbers, expiration dates, distribution history, and other pertinent data, is securely stored. This information is associated with each drug's unique identifier, allowing users to access and verify the authenticity of a drug by scanning its barcode or entering its serial number into the application.

The DApp ensures transparency and integrity by storing information in an immutable manner on the blockchain, preventing tampering or alterations. Through Ezigbo, users, including consumers, pharmacists, and regulatory bodies, can access comprehensive drug details, fostering trust and confidence in the authenticity and quality of medications.
